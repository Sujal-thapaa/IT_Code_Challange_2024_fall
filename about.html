                Organized in 1952, the ULM Alumni Association is an independent, non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote 
                the welfare of the university through friend raising efforts aimed at cultivating an engaged and mutually beneficial 
                relationship between ULM and its growing community of alumni, students, faculty and stakeholders. We provide and support 
                alumni programs and services, facilitate communication with alumni and seek to strengthen alumni bonds of fellowship, 
                professional association and university affiliation. We encourage alumni to stay connected and serve as advocates for 
                the university. We leverage the resources, talents, and initiatives of alumni and friends to advise, guide, advocate for
                 and support the Association and the university in achieving their respective missions and goals. We affirm the value of 
                 human diversity and the enrichment it brings to our lives and acknowledge our differences, rejecting all forms of prejudice
                  and discrimination. We value integrity, honesty, and ethical behavior and strive to maintain a working environment that is 
                  built on mutual respect, understanding and freedom of expression.

                The Alumni Association draws its membership from over 65,000 living graduates worldwide and adds more chapters and clubs each 
                year. Events hosted by the Alumni Association chapters and clubs bring alumni, friends, faculty and staff, and future students
                 together to share the ULM experience throughout the year.</h4></p>
